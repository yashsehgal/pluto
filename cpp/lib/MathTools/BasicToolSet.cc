/**
 * This is the c++ version of BasicToolSet module
 * This is the most basic module of Pluto framework which contains the 
 * basic math tools and functions.

* ! This module is for user development use and does not conatains any out-sourced data.

* Todo: To develop user friendly coding feature using basic class and function methods
* Todo: Use inner function interchange to do specific tests

* This is our main class for Basic Tools Set method of MathTools code bundle package
* The class method has all the useful functions and methods that the user can use throughout this module.
