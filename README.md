# Pluto

### Version 1.11
[Release 1.11](https://github.com/yashsehgal/pluto) is now available for free, on GitHub

## Coming Soon
*   Pluto v.1.12 with AdvancedMath feature tool.
*   More efficient and easy method of using mathematical tools feature.

## About Pluto
Pluto is a Python based framework for fast and more efficient function based development. It contains some basic functions like classic math function and some other bruteforce formulations that you may use in your code without writing any rocket-science formula.


## About Developer
Hey fellow developers, I am Yash Sehgal from Indore, India. I developed this code base when I was in my High-School. I created this for my personal use but I thought I should continue this program and optimise it at different levels. I am glad that you are using this or may not be using, that's fine.

## Description
The code base has mostly python and c++ based modules and totally free for open-source development. Currently, this file is under development phase but their are no such bugs which will crash so that you may use this on your system. This program contains so many math related modules and other special function which you may apply in you codebase. From normal addition and subtraction to derivative computers, you will have various functions in this module.

## Features

*   Mathematical Tools for Basic Math Operations
*   Mathematical Tools for Complex Math Operations
*   Tools for basic Chemistry based Theories
*   Speech Recognition module for speech related tasks

## Platforms
Pluto is easy to install and use on any platform you want:

*   Mac OS X
*   Linux
*   Windows
*   Cygwin
*   MinGW
*   Ubuntu
